📜 Licensed under AGPL-3.0 with brand protections — free & open for all, but misuse will face strict legal action.

“The first open protocol for user-owned AI memory — neutral, private, future-proof.”
## 🌍 About NMP
The **Neutral Memory Protocol (NMP)** is the first open standard for **user-owned AI memory**.  
In a world where digital memory is often centralized and controlled, NMP ensures neutrality, transparency, and user ownership.  

Just as **HTTP** became the foundation of the web, NMP is designed to be the foundation for AI systems and the memory layer of the internet.

---

## ✨ Core Principles
- **Neutrality** → Memory must remain free from control of any single entity.  
- **User Ownership** → You own, manage, and control your data.  
- **Transparency** → Open governance and community-driven development.  
- **Future-Proof** → Built as a long-term standard for AI and the web.  

---

## 🚀 Current Status
NMP is at its early stage.  
- ✅ Repository initialized (vision, license, foundation).  
- 🔄 Building the first **NMP Wallet MVP** — a local-first, user-owned memory vault.  
- ⏳ Coming updates: SDKs, governance drafts, and contribution guidelines.  

---

## 📌 Roadmap (High-Level)
1. **MVP Wallet (Month 1–2)** → User-owned memory vault, basic API.  
2. **Developer SDK (Year 1)** → Python + JavaScript libraries for integration.  
3. **Standards Draft (Year 2)** → Formal NMP specification with community input.  
4. **Ecosystem Apps (Year 3–4)** → Extensions, AI tools, interoperability.  
5. **Global Adoption (Year 5+)** → Establish NMP as the memory layer for AI + web.

## ⚠️ Disadvantages & Challenges
We acknowledge challenges openly:  
- 🐢 Slow adoption (counter: start with MVP Wallet).  
- 🕵️ Trust barrier (counter: open-source transparency).  
- 🏢 Big tech pushback (counter: trademark + certification).  
- 🔓 Privacy risks (counter: encryption, audits).  
- 🧩 User complexity (counter: simple UX focus).
